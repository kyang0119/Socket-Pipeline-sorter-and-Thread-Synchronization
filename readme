note: 

This program works, I have attached screenshos of my running results. 
but because the instability of the internet , sometimes connection will break and may not work. 
Pleas run a few times if the firs time is not successful. 
Please read !most important! below , it explains unsuccessful run. 

How to run : 
1. type: "make " , it will generae "admin.exe" "clien.exe" or you can use the ".admin.exe" or ".client.txt" 
    I already included.  
2. type" ./admin.exe " to run admin.exe
3. open another teminal and type" ./clien.exe 48" , the second number(48)is user input CID number, 
    you may enter any number you wish. 
4. enter file name "sortin.txt" or "sortreq2.in.txt" or "sortin2.txt" and enter . These 3 .txt files are 
    included in my project folder. 
5. if you want send another file.  run "./client.exe 23" again , and submit the file needed to be sorted. 
    the "23" can be any number you want to give as the CID numbe.  
6. type “make clean” to clean the intemediae .o file.s 

! most important ! note: if client stuck at "array sent to server" , it is usually because the receive part is not successful . 
control c in client terminal to terminate , and you will see the error message in admin. exe. 
control c in admin terminal to terminate, and repeat step 2- step 6 to re-run admin.exe and client.exe
